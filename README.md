## Hello, 
### In my career i got and I conducted a lot of java and kotlin interviews and I got a big bunch of small tasks.

## Why are them?
### Honestly, I don't like asking algorithm, because in my opinion it isn't really shows people skills in developing? and also it takes a lot of time to write a solution, to discuss it. But this small tasks is the best solution for interviewer to try candidate.

## How to work with?
### Open task.md files, read the question and try to solve it. With task there is also a link to solution and to task in class just to implement solution.
