# 🚀 Welcome!

## About This Repository
In my career, I've participated in and conducted numerous **Java** and **Kotlin** interviews. Over time, I’ve collected a treasure trove of **small tasks** designed to test practical development skills.

### 🤔 Why These Tasks?
Let's face it—asking algorithm-based questions during interviews isn’t always effective.
- **Algorithms** often don’t reflect real-world development skills.
- They can be time-consuming to solve and discuss.

Instead, these **small tasks** serve as a better way for interviewers to evaluate a candidate’s abilities. They’re concise, practical, and closely aligned with day-to-day development work.

### 🛠️ How to Use This Repository
1. Navigate to the `task.md` files in the respective directories.
2. Read the question carefully and try to solve it.
3. Check your solution against the provided answer or reference the accompanying class to implement your own solution.
